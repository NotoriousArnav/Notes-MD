Cache memory is a type of high-speed semiconductor memory that: 
    - Aids in speeding up the CPU's performance.
    - Serves as a buffer between the CPU and the main memory.
    - Stores frequently used data and programs that the CPU accesses frequently.

**Advantages of Cache Memory:**

- It offers faster access times compared to the main memory.
- It reduces the time required for data access when compared to the main memory.
- Cache memory stores programs that can be executed quickly.
- It temporarily stores data that is currently in use.

**Disadvantages of Cache Memory:**

- Cache memory can be costly due to the use of semiconductors.
- The size of the cache (i.e., the amount of data it can store) is typically small.
