## What is Coding?

Coding is the process of communicating with a computer by providing instructions. Computers are essentially dumb machines that need precise directions to perform tasks. We use different programming languages for this communication. Some languages are low-level, like Machine Language and C, which are closer to the computer's understanding. Others, like Python, are high-level and require more processing time to transfer commands to the computer's hardware.

Programming languages act as an intermediary between humans and computers, making it easier for us to convey our instructions effectively.

## History of C Language

C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 while he was working at AT&T's Bell Laboratories. Before C, programming languages like B and BCPL were in use, but they had limitations. C gained popularity rapidly in the tech industry due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Course Content

This course is designed to take you from a beginner to an expert level in C programming. It's structured to ensure a smooth learning curve:

- **Beginner Level**: Starting with fundamental topics such as data types, operators, and if-else statements. These basics form the foundation of the C language.
    
- **Intermediate Level**: Progressing to more advanced topics like Strings, Arrays, and Pointers. These concepts are crucial for writing more complex programs.
    
- **Advanced Level**: Concluding with advanced topics like File I/O and Function Pointers. These are essential for building sophisticated applications.
    

The course also includes numerous exercises to test your skills and evaluate your progress.

## Summary

Taking this course seriously can turn you into an expert C programmer. Additionally, the knowledge gained in C programming will benefit you in learning other languages like C++ and Python, as they share similarities with C. Learning C is like having a solid foundation for about 60-70% of C++ as well.

Remember to follow the course sequence for the best learning experience. Starting with the basics and progressively moving to more advanced topics will help you become a proficient programmer. Good luck with your studies!
