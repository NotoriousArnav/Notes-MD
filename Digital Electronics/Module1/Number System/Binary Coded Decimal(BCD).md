BCD is a binary representation of decimal numbers in which each decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary code. It's a method used to precisely represent decimal numbers in a binary format. Here are some key points about BCD:

- Each decimal digit from 0 to 9 is represented by a 4-bit binary code, with each digit taking up a nibble (4 bits).
- BCD is commonly used in applications where accurate decimal representation is required, such as in financial and numeric display systems.
### Decimal Digit to BCD Conversion Examples:

- Decimal 7 in BCD: 0111
- Decimal 5 in BCD: 0101
### BCD Arithmetic Operations

#### 1. BCD Addition

BCD addition follows these rules:

- 0 + 0 = 0
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 10 (with 1 carry)

Let's add two BCD numbers, 7 and 5, using BCD addition rules:
```sql
   0111   (BCD for 7)
 + 0101   (BCD for 5)
-------
   1100   (BCD for 12, with a carry of 1)

```
The result is 12 in BCD format with a carry of 1.
#### 2. BCD Subtraction

BCD subtraction follows these rules:

- 0 - 0 = 0
- 1 - 0 = 1
- 1 - 1 = 0
- 10 - 1 = 1

Let's subtract 5 from 7 in BCD using BCD subtraction rules:
```sql
  0111   (BCD for 7)
 -0101   (BCD for 5)
-------
  0010   (BCD for 2)

```
The result is 2 in BCD format.
#### 3. BCD Multiplication

BCD multiplication is straightforward, with these rules:

- 0 * 1 = 0
- 1 * 1 = 1

Suppose we want to multiply two BCD-encoded numbers, A (5 in decimal, 0101 in BCD) and B (3 in decimal, 0011 in BCD):
```sql
   0101   (BCD for A, 5 in decimal)
 x 0011   (BCD for B, 3 in decimal)
 --------
  00101   (First BCD product, 5)
  01010   (Second BCD product, 10)
 --------
  11011   (BCD result, 11 in decimal)

```
#### 4. BCD Division

BCD division is as follows:
```sql
  1100   (BCD for D, 12 in decimal)
รท 0011   (BCD for d, 3 in decimal)
 --------
  0100   (BCD quotient, 4 in decimal)

```
These BCD operations are fundamental in digital arithmetic and play a significant role in various applications.
